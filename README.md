# 🐢 Turtle Dash

A fun and interactive racing game built with Python's turtle module where colorful turtles compete to reach the finish line!

## 📋 Description

Turtle Dash is an exciting Python game that simulates a race between 2-10 turtles. Players choose how many racers they want, and then watch as the turtles move forward by random distances in each turn, creating an unpredictable and thrilling race to the finish line. The game leverages Python's built-in turtle graphics module to provide a colorful visual experience.

## 🧩 How It Works

The game works through these key components:

- **Turtle Setup**: Creates a race track and initializes turtle racers
- **Race Logic**: Each turtle moves forward a random distance (1-20 pixels) per turn
- **Win Detection**: Checks if any turtle has crossed the finish line
- **User Input**: Validates player input for number of racers
- **Randomization**: Ensures unpredictable and exciting races

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

- Implement a betting system to guess the winning turtle
- Add multiple race tracks with different themes
- Create obstacles that turtles must navigate around
- Add a tournament mode with multiple races
- Include sound effects for more immersion
- Design a graphical user interface for game settings
- Add turtle animations and victory celebrations
